Do Something Extra:
-------------------

 - Matt Durak: Dot File Generation
    - Added a Visitor to walk the Statement trees and output a dot file
    - To test this, add the "-d" switch followed by an output file name to the
      command line args.  After the completion of the program, the dot file
      will be generated.
 - Matt Durak: Statistics Functions
    - Added functions to calculate the mean, sum (called add), and standard
      deviation (std) of a list of expressions.  The results of the functions
      are expresssions so they may actually be nested.  See "teststats" for
      some examples of this in action.
